"what's the appeal of vi? it seems to me that editors like vscode, sublime text and atom are far superior. they are designed for writing code and color code based on different languages and have extensions so you can customize. they'll warn of syntax errors, spelling errors, variables not in use, and so on. they'll also autoformat, lint check, bracket match, auto-complete code, intellisense, auto-rename matching tags, auto-close tags, and so much more. i don't think vi does any of that, plus you have to change modes between insert, overwrite and command mode. if you forget your in command mode and start typing, suddenly you can find you've executed a long set of commands putting yourself in a weird state.","Patrick Coston","1","3","2021-06-07T17:39:31Z","UgzxaWO4rOxCnVyz9sx4AaABAg","None","FALSE","0eIY5b0RKE0", 71.000000000,  0.000000000,  0.084507042,  0.084507042,  0.000000000,  0.000000000,  0.000000000, -0.028169014,  0.042253521,  0.014084507,  0.056338028,  0.014084507,  0.084507042,  0.098591549, 71,neutral,0.08450704,0.08450704,neutral,0.000000000,0.000000000,negative,0.04225352,0.014084507,0.056338028,positive,0.08450704,0.09859155

"i love your videos! i had one quibble about your sql solution to #1. if some publishers have more videos than others, then their video durations will affect the mean. you could imagine one publisher with 10,000 videos and 9 publishers with 10 videos. in this case, the average duration of that one super-publisher's videos will have way more influence on the mean than the other publishers. i think your question is better answered by first computing an average for each publisher and then averaging those averages.

"i wonder. do you ever think about depression in terms of a system. like a symbiosis. it's more marked with my condition, schizophrenia. but really the state of the art with what science thinks is going on is brain chemistry. basically dopamine is different in schizophrenics. but in terms of systems, if you think about fear, as a systemic process we see something that triggers our brain to go into a different mode which manifests chemical changes, so e tongue sticking out erience provokes brain chemistry, adrenaline. adrenaline impacts psychology. so e tongue sticking out erience impacts chemistry which impacts psychology. it's interesting to think that this is how a lot of stuff might work with psychology and mood. people always think about depression now in terms of chemistry, but it's almost like the perception of brain chemistry for a depressive is you are passive. you're unlucky in terms of the brain you got doesn't work right. and you sit back and take meds because your brain works the way it works irrespective. does this passive attitude submit. because if the condition is a symbiotic cycle, then the cycle for a clinical depressive will be a loop that perpetuates. so there will be no logical difference between the perception that you have no choice, and that being the reality. that you have no choice.. because the data, the e tongue sticking out erience in the system, manifests the same result. people always seem to think everything about the condition is a constant. and really e tongue sticking out erience is a variable. it's not going to be the complete picture because different people have different chemistry and also different psychology. so the proposition that this is like a machine would rely on chemistry and psychology in terms of response being the same, which patently it isn't. but what it does do is change one of the constants in perception from a constant to a variable. and you wonder is modulation of this variable enough to leverage mood. bullshit really. but they always say do practical things... e tongue sticking out erience..","malefeminist giangilo","1","0","2019-04-02T07:50:56Z","UgwdtcpXgkVoD1K24h94AaABAg","None","FALSE","d0pBDqGIDPM",171.000000000, -0.005847953,  0.105263158,  0.099415205, -0.023391813,  0.023391813,  0.000000000, -0.046783626,  0.046783626,  0.000000000,  0.087719298,  0.046783626,  0.058479532,  0.105263158,171,negative,0.10526316,0.09941520,negative,0.023391813,0.000000000,negative,0.04678363,0.000000000,0.087719298,positive,0.05847953,0.10526316

"hi joma & all, it appears to me that a lot of people are in overdrive mode nowadays. there is too much information we want to process, too less focus on things that require dedication and patience, and an online world that suggests that you should always keep going, because otherwise you might just be a loser or too slow for this world. i strongly believe that people were just not made for today's stressful environment. psychotherapists are booked for months in advance, with waiting times of up to a year (here in germany). everybody has heard about burn-outs, but nobody really wants to talk about it. once you start talking about it, though, you will quickly realize that other people will open up to you, as it just requires one to make the first move to trigger a discussion and a truthful exchange of thoughts about stress, be it self-imposed or not. so, making this video is the right step, in my opinion. at the same time, however, you should not force yourself to ""get back to normal"" or ""work hard to recover your earlier lifestyle"". both your mind and body are telling you that they cannot keep that past lifestyle, that change is indeed required. less is more, and taking a lot of time for yourself is very important. i'm currently burned out as well. it has been four weeks and i'm only slowly recovering. what i have learned so far is to just sit still for 30 minutes in the morning and in the afternoon, doing nothing. just focus on your breath and look inside your body in terms of any aches, thoughts, or whatever else it might be. just observe, don't judge. accept your thoughts, accept what your body tells you. your body is your friend, not your failed enemy who just can't deliver any more. acceptance and attention to what is going on is indeed key. just don't force yourself to want something, because for the time being, your psyche and body is not going to give it to you. they might just shut down and put you back on square one again and again. be patient, be aware of what you need, and don't put pressure on you.","Ingo T","0","0","2019-03-16T09:17:08Z","UgxZjXkEubjXlfdvXz54AaABAg","None","FALSE","d0pBDqGIDPM",173.000000000,  0.132947977,  0.098265896,  0.231213873, -0.005780347,  0.017341040,  0.011560694, -0.040462428,  0.063583815,  0.023121387,  0.034682081,  0.127167630,  0.075144509,  0.202312139,173,positive,0.09826590,0.23121387,negative,0.017341040,0.011560694,negative,0.06358382,0.023121387,0.034682081,positive,0.07514451,0.20231214

"i always liked problem solving. it has been the main motive in my entire life in everything i do - from the simplest functions like breathing (solving the problem of otherwise lacking oxygen in my body), to the most complicated mathematical problems i've ever solved, to the emotional and psychological ones. i see programming as a brush, the software engine as colors, and the final product is art. programming itself is like painting without color. software development is - art. you create anything you want. from applications to video games and animations, you can do anything you want. to me, a software developer or engineer is as creative as a painter. i may make jokes about my mind not being creative, but really, it is not true. my creativity field isn't in colors - it's in software, it's in outside the box thinking and in creating something that will help people. things that i find would be great to exist, yet nobody has ever made them. that is art. it's innovation. being a coder includes just writing code. less fun than calculating. being a programmer includes solving problems through the use of coding. being a software developer includes creative programming in order to fullfill the needs of others. help people. it is why i will never work in microsoft, google or even apple. i will never work at ea or other such companies. they are in this for the money. i am in it for art. and it is why i will succeed. i don't need 10 super e tongue sticking out ensive cars, big apartments, a swimming pool, a square kilometer of spare land and a private aircraft carrier including a set of 5 private jets. nobody does. i just want to love my job. and i love creating. and calculating and problem solving. that is my future. and should be a future of all who want to be a programmer. don't be that - be more. be an artist.","Shyper","2","0","2022-08-15T22:17:04Z","Ugzoyg50Of4rTN1IH6x4AaABAg","None","FALSE","EiKK04Ht8QI",168.000000000,  0.142857143,  0.113095238,  0.255952381,  0.000000000,  0.005952381,  0.005952381,  0.005952381,  0.065476190,  0.071428571,  0.005952381,  0.142857143,  0.053571429,  0.196428571,168,positive,0.11309524,0.25595238,neutral,0.005952381,0.005952381,positive,0.06547619,0.071428571,0.005952381,positive,0.05357143,0.19642857

"takeaway if you can help companies solve 1,000,000 dollar problems, you will be very successful. his brother's startup identified the million dollar problem associated with realestate and developed an ine tongue sticking out ensive solution to this problem, i.e. they built a machine learning application to answer questions and help schedule appointments. below is an example of how to idenitfy the million dollar problem. agents were spending a lot of time answering trivial questions, time that could be spent closing deals. say an agent is able to close enough deals in one year to net 250,000 in revenue. since the agents is occupied answering trivial questions, time is wasted that can lead to additional revenue. if the agents had more time, i.e. the agents had more appointments lined up to show off properties, they might bring in 400,000 in revenue a year. say you employ 10 agents, so they currently bring in 2,500,000 in revenue but could be brining in 4,000,000. you then come and say, ""hey, you could be making 1,500,000 more in revenue. i have a tool that can help your agents close more deals."" this video did a wonderful job of outlining what the business challenge was and what the solution looked like. the fact that the startup sold for 60,000,000 leads me to think that their machine learning solution will help save millions of dollars for its clients. if you want to have your own startup, you need to ask yourself, ""so what? why is your startup any different?"" if your response is, ""well, you know that million dollar problem you have? i have a cheap solution to fix that,"" you will have success. if your solution does not fix a million dollar problem, then you better have a really, really, really good alternate reason why your startup matters. one other thing, you need to be an industry insider. if you want to have your own startup, you need to have previous e tongue sticking out erience in the industry. for example, if you are a professional coder, don't think you can start a business building nuclear reactors. his brother's startup most likely had someone already involved in realestate, hence their startup's ability to build a good solution for the realestate industry. who am i? i have a degree in mechanical engineering. i have worked as a product marketer before. now i develop web applications that help mechanical and structural engineers perform magic. wink solve million dollar problems + industry insider = profit","Chris A","2","0","2022-07-29T20:40:37Z","UgyeN5VFfjW8vI3AemZ4AaABAg","None","FALSE","fB7nyxXaczY",217.000000000,  0.078341014,  0.175115207,  0.253456221,  0.027649770,  0.004608295,  0.032258065, -0.036866359,  0.087557604,  0.050691244,  0.009216590,  0.110599078,  0.069124424,  0.179723502,217,positive,0.17511521,0.25345622,positive,0.004608295,0.032258065,negative,0.08755760,0.050691244,0.009216590,positive,0.06912442,0.17972350

"loved the short answer and cut to credits that was accurate and hilarious! laughing i thought wes mckinney and hadley wickham were focused to make differences between r and python moot with ursa labs? anaconda supports this to extent as well supplying conda environments for both r and python. even before ursa pandas + rpy2 or reticulate on the r side already allow for interoperability between the two so while one language might be more intuitive to one user than the other in the long run it probably will not matter much which you use since i think the trajectory is convergence not one over the other. are people really moving away from r to python or are there just more people getting trained in python over r in the market overall? the later i find believable all else held the same simply because there are more cs, engineering, and physics graduates than math and stats ones never mind additional factors for other majors or the effect of bootcamps and mooc's and their distribution of python vs r options. i would be curious to see some details to support existing r users abandoning r in favor of python. jupyter is fine for tinkering around with an analysis, but it is no replacement for an ide and does not provide a good path for operationalizing your code or for supporting larger projects. also, it is possible to run an r kernel from a jupyter notebook so if the notebook format is preferable for summarizing an analysis that is always an option. shiny is a web application framework for r. so while i agree python is more common overall for web applications one certainly could in r if one wanted to. they are both interpreted languages they are far more similar than different as languages, white space sensitivity in python aside. [what is this fortran? wink ] like your videos a lot just had something to say so i went for it sorry its long. smiley ","Chris Simokat","0","3","2018-09-07T20:57:40Z","UgwnB1hQL2WiBP6AQJR4AaABAg","None","FALSE","k2RqjYCTt6k",165.000000000,  0.109090909,  0.096969697,  0.206060606,  0.018181818,  0.000000000,  0.018181818, -0.006060606,  0.024242424,  0.018181818,  0.036363636,  0.121212121,  0.030303030,  0.151515152,165,positive,0.09696970,0.20606061,positive,0.000000000,0.018181818,negative,0.02424242,0.018181818,0.036363636,positive,0.03030303,0.15151515

"one solution to that problem is to simply have a hashtable/hashmap that stores every number we see in the int array, followed by the difference needed for each number to equal the sum. so we iterate through the array and ask, ""hmm have i seen the difference between the current element and the desired sum? yes? ok i found two elements that add up to this sum. no? well then i'll just store this element in my hashmap and the difference i wish i had with it."" now if i go through the entire array without finding the 2 elements, i can return false. that's a big o(n) runtime when n is the number of ints in the array and a memory space of o(n) since at worst i've stored every element in the hashmap. i could speed this up slightly bu initially sorting the array in ascending order with merge sort (n*log(n)) so now i can go through my array up until i see an element that is either equal to or greater than my sum. no point in asking if the element 10 plus some other element will equal to my smaller sum since that's just impossible. anyone else have a faster run time? another method that may be faster is to have two pointers at opposite ends of the array. after sorting the array, one pointer is at the start and another is at the end. if the sum of those two elements is less than the desired sum, i should increment my left pointer. if the sum of the two pointers is greater than the desired sum, i should decrement the right pointer to decrease the next potential sum. still a worst case big o(n) but no memory is used aside from the two pointers.","Mohy CS","1","4","2018-08-31T04:01:54Z","Ugz0hHZxHiKyuR61GBJ4AaABAg","None","FALSE","Ru8s5qjMKdU",149.000000000, -0.033557047,  0.134228188,  0.100671141, -0.020134228,  0.033557047,  0.013422819, -0.020134228,  0.053691275,  0.033557047,  0.026845638,  0.033557047,  0.053691275,  0.087248322,149,negative,0.13422819,0.10067114,negative,0.033557047,0.013422819,negative,0.05369128,0.033557047,0.026845638,positive,0.05369128,0.08724832
