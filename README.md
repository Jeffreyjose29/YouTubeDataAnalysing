**Aim:** The aim of this project is to dwell into the statistics of any given YouTube channel and identify important stats such as viewership growth, key video titles which drive views and other key information.  

The project is completed using R as the primary language and RStudio as the IDE of choice. 

## Data Sources

A large majority of the data used within this project is web-scraped using the Google YouTube API pass which allows an user to scrap the latest data on any social channel through the script itself.  

**There are 3 steps in order to scrap YouTube data:**

1. Get your YouTube API key for free.
2. Sample YouTube Data API calls.
3. Sample Code in R. 

## Step 1: Get a YouTube API Key 

YouTube shares information through their product, the <a href = "https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/"><i>YouTube Data API</i></a>.

The YouTube Data API is part of the Google Cloud Platform and it is essential that in order to legally extract data from YouTube, you would be required to sign-up for a **Google Cloud Account**, using your **Google Account**.
